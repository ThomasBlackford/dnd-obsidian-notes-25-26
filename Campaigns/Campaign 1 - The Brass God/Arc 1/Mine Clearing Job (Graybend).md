### **Setup**

After the pub collapse and their return from the underground, the party is summoned by **Mayor Harken** of Greybend.

- He thanks them for surviving and calming the townsfolk.
    
- Then he mentions a pressing problem:
    
    > “The tremor shook loose more than stone. The **old mines east of town** have long been abandoned… but lately, travelers and loggers whisper of **bandits lairing there.** With half my guard injured or busy, I cannot send men. I would ask _you,_ heroes of the quake, to investigate.”
    

If the party hesitates, a villager adds fuel:

- A child claims to have seen **strange lights flickering in the mine at night.**
    
- A logger swears he heard **skittering** from the mine mouth.
    
- Another says their wagon was raided by bandits.
    

This gives the mission both a mundane (bandit raid) and supernatural (strange lights) hook.

### **Mine Features**

- Old support beams cracked and groaning.
    
- The air smells of **damp stone, smoke, and rot.**
    
- Graffiti in charcoal marks the walls: crude bandit symbols mixed with **older glyphs of spiders and webs.**
    
- **Environmental hazard:** Occasional tremor aftershocks cause debris to fall (Dex save for minor damage).
    
- Deep in the mine, one tunnel is bricked and sealed with a rusted **wench mechanism** — the barrier holds back an **underdark breach.**

### **Key Encounters**

#### **1. The Guard Post**

- At the mine mouth, 3 **bandit scouts** lounge by a fire.
    
- DC 13 Stealth to sneak up. If alarmed, one flees deeper to warn others.
    
- Clues: crude maps showing **supply raids** against Greybend’s lumber mill.
    

---

#### **2. The Barracks Chamber**

- A cavern strung with hammocks, crates, and stolen goods.
    
- 6 **bandits** + 1 **bandit thug (lieutenant).**
    
- They may parley if cornered, offering loot in exchange for safe passage.
    
- Older carvings in the stone resemble **spider sigils** — ignored by the bandits.
    

---

#### **3. The Pitfall Tunnel**

- Narrow passage with a **hidden pit trap** (DC 14 Perception, DC 13 Dex save).
    
- Skeletons of miners and bandits lie at the bottom. One clutching a **spider-shaped amulet**, blackened but still intact.
    
- The amulet hums faintly near the sealed underdark breach.
    

---

#### **4. The Spider Altar (Hidden Chamber)**

Optional discovery.

- Side tunnel leads to a **small shrine** — an altar shaped like a spider, covered in dust and cracked webbing.
    
- Arcana/Religion check reveals it as a **long-forgotten cult of Lolth**, dating back to the mine’s earliest days.
    
- Any light source makes the shadows seem to **writhe with legs** (illusion only).
    
- If desecrated: faint chittering echoes through the mine, and a spider swarm (or giant spider, scaled for 7) attacks.
    
- This links to the **sealed breach** nearby — hinting the cult was trying to widen it.

#### **5. The Boss’s Hall**

- Reinforced chamber with crates of loot and a rough map of the region (hinting at a larger bandit network).
    
- **Boss: Garrick “Ironhand”**, grizzled ex-soldier turned bandit captain.
    
    - Wields a heavy mace (+1, reward).
        
    - With him: 2 bandit thugs.
        
- Garrick doesn’t trust the mine:
    
    > “There’s… something down there, past the wench-sealed tunnels. Heard it hum. Felt the air change. We wanted no part of it.”

### **Resolution**

- **If bandits are slain**: Mayor rewards them (coin, goods, or reputation).
    
- **If bandits scattered/negotiated**: The townsfolk are uneasy but accept the mines are cleared “for now.”
    
- PCs uncover:
    
    - Evidence of bandit raids.
        
    - Rumors of **brass walls** deeper in the tunnels.
        
    - A spider altar and sealed breach hinting at darker history.
        

---

### **Scaling for 7 Players**

- Guard Post: 3 scouts.
    
- Barracks: 6 bandits + 1 thug.
    
- Boss Room: 1 Captain + 2 thugs.
    
- Optional Altar Fight: spider swarm **or** 1 giant spider.
    
- Use waves for big fights so it doesn’t bog down.
    

---

### **Rewards**

- 50–75 gp in stolen goods, returned to townsfolk.
    
- **Mace of Ironhand** (+1, dented but sturdy).
    
- **Spider Amulet** (cosmetic, but may resonate later if Lolth cults resurface).
    
- Trinkets hinting at Brass God (a brass coin, gear-shaped pendant).
    
- Free room & board at Greybend’s inn.

### **Why This Works**

- The **bandit angle** makes the job feel urgent and believable.
    
- The **spider altar + sealed breach** drip-feed you world lore without forcing it.
    
- Gives the party both **social consequences** (mayor’s opinion, villagers’ respect) and **mythic foreshadowing** (Lolth, underdark, Brass God).
