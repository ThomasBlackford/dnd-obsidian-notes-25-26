# **Session 1: Echoes Beneath Greybend**

### **Opening Scene – The Stump Pub**

The party begins their journey in the quiet logging village of [[Greybend]], gathered at the well-worn local tavern, **The Stump Pub**.

- Prompt each player:  
    _What brings your character to this sleepy village? Why are you in the pub tonight? What are you doing as the scene opens?_  
    Use this moment to let personalities emerge naturally—some may be drinking, brooding, watching, or chatting.
    
- Introduce **Old Bix**:  
    A retired adventurer turned local legend. He drinks for free in exchange for his stories—often exaggerated, always entertaining. He might be midway through telling a tale of a forgotten war, a buried treasure, or a monster that "spoke in thunder." Let this scene breathe.

### **The Collapse**

Without warning, the ground beneath the pub **rumbles violently**, mugs shatter, chairs tip—then a loud _crack_ as a section of the floor **collapses inward**, swallowing the party and Old Bix.

They fall into darkness.

---

### **Chamber 1 – The Fallen Room**

The party awakens in a chamber of **splintered wood, broken chairs**, and collapsed stone. One torch lies miraculously still lit, flickering across the dust-choked ruin.

- The way back up is **sealed by rubble**—impassable without excavation tools or magic.
    
- **Old Bix** is crushed beneath beams and debris. He is **mortally wounded**—you can roleplay his final words if desired. He may hint at something he saw down here once, long ago, or die simply urging them to escape. He won’t survive more than a few minutes.
    

Two tunnels lead deeper into the earth:

---

### **Tunnel A – The Safe Path**

- **Reinforced**, with old timber supports.
    
- Leads to an **ancient tomb**.
    
- Linear route but includes a combat encounter.
    

### **Tunnel B – The Risky Shortcut**

- **Semi-collapsed**, unstable.
    
- Requires a **Dexterity (Acrobatics) check** to avoid falling rubble.
    
- Skips the first combat but risks injury or splitting the party.
    

---

### **Chamber 2 – The Forgotten Tomb**

A circular room lined with **dusty coffins** and **six magical ever-burning torches**. Four imposing **statues of armored men** stand in each corner.

- When the players enter, **three skeletons claw up from the floor**, initiating combat.
    
- After battle, players can notice a **weakened wall** opposite the entrance. It can be broken with force or clever use of tools/spells.
    

---

### **Chamber 3 – The River Crossing**

Beyond the broken wall lies a **subterranean river**, dark and fast-moving.

- A crude **plank-and-log bridge** crosses it.
    
- The bridge is unstable—players can:
    
    - Attempt a **Dexterity (Acrobatics) check** to cross.
        
    - Use ropes, boards, or magic to **reinforce** it.
        
    - Risk falling into the water, which could sweep them away or cause injury.
        

---

### **Final Chamber – The Altar of the Forgotten**

A large circular chamber with a **cracked, rusted altar** at its center.

- Atop the altar is a **small iron lockbox**.
    
- Around the room, **four large metal "ribs"** protrude from the stone, faintly **humming** with arcane energy. These are part of **The Brass God**, though the players won’t know this.
    
- The lockbox contains **[[The Brass God’s Eye]]**—a glassy orb with subtle magical resonance.
    
- As they investigate, a **Brass Construct** in the corner stirs to life:
    
    - It lumbers forward, damaged and malfunctioning.
        
    - Survives **only one round** before it **overheats and explodes** in a burst of sparks and force. Optional: allow a check to disable or minimize damage.
        

Behind a **faded statue**, a **narrow crevice** leads into an **old mining tunnel**. A **rope ladder** descends from a half-collapsed shaft above, offering a route back to the surface—likely surfacing near the old Greybend mine.

## Session 2 - The Aftermath
After the party surfaces, they see Greybend in the distance. Intact, but smoking, and villagers gathering, having felt the quake.

### Consequences #dm-only
The quake was felt across the region. Not just the pub, and this comes with rumors.
The townsfolk blame old mining tunnels collpasing, gods punishing them, and such.

Some more wide-spread and notable reactions.

- Scholars from Cidrid have come to investigate, and have been spotted by locals. PC's may find them. (See [[Scholars of Cidrid]]).
- In Wavehold, rumors flood in from traders and locals. Some nobles are curious, dispatching scouts to the area. Most treat it as a random event, just a mine collapsing.
- Other towns know of the event, but think nothing of it. Just an unlucky situation.
- Word of this quake has gotten word to [[Varethian Dynasty]], who seems to know something about the region and are investigating.
