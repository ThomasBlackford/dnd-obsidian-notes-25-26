Daizora is a small, centeral island-nation famed for its legal institutions, innovation, and cultural prestige. It is ruled by the [[Court of Daizora]].

### Geographical Features
While Daizora is not defined into "regions" since it is so small, it does have notable features.
- [[The Marble Crown]], a highland plateau at the islands center, ringed by elegant white cliffs. The Capital was built atop it.
- [[The Lacune Bay]], a deep natural harbor carved away by ancient floods. Now Daizora's major trade hub, flooded with foreign ships, diplomats, spies...
- [[The Gloaming Trench]], a deep sea rift right off the western coast of Daizora, is warded as off-limits by all.
