Once was a largely poor continent pre-sundering, but after the cataclysm, it has risen as the worlds superpower. Dominated by two empires, the [[Serathian Empire]] and the [[Halcarnate Throne]], it is the largest of all 6 continents, and houses the great Solmir Sands, alongside many other natural wonders. 

### Geographical Features
Ausicand can be divided into 5 regions, the [[Great Solmir Sands]], the [[Western Shore]], the [[Windmere Reach]], the [[Redtine Steppe]], and the [[Crown Tundra]].

### Political Landscape
- The Serathian Empire are desert peoples who rule over the Great Solmir Sands, alongside having control of the Western shore. A mighty force, it dominates the region with strong militaristic presence.
- The Halcarnate Throne controls the fertile heartlands of the Windmere Reach, the harsh fronteir of the Redtine steppe, and the frozen wilds of the Crown Tundra. Unlike their Serathian rivals, the Halcarnate rule through bloodlines, bureaucracy, and divine right. Their leadership is centralized around the ruling line of the Halcarnate blood, believed to be chosen by a celestial force during the Sundering.  While lacking the Serathian military machine, the Throne commands immense economic power through trade, resource control, and a complex caste system that ensures loyalty from the lower provinces.  The Crown Tundra remains a semi-autonomous protectorate under the Halcarnate banner — cold, dangerous, and culturally distant, but rich in arcane ores and relics unearthed post-Sundering.

#### Current Tensions
- Border Standoff in the Redtine Steppe
		Skirmishes and fortifications are escalating along the Serathian-Halcarnate border in the Redtinne Steppe. Neither side wants open war, but both are funneling troops, mercenaries, and "exploratory caravans" into the frontier.
- Trade War over the Western Shore
		Halcarnate Trade Guilds accuse the Serathian Empire of seizing merchant ships and imposing unfair tariffs on ports in the Western Shore.
		Serathians claim the trade routes were always theirs and now enforce naval blockades under "cultural sovereignty."
- Succession Crisis in the Halcarnate Throne
		The current Highblood ruler is aging, and the internal noble factions are preparing for a brutal political contest. The Serathians are suspected of backing a claimant secretly, hoping to fracture the Throne from within.

### Points of Interest
- [[The Obsidian Maw]] - Great Solimir Sands
		A mile-wide, perfectly circular chasm in the desert floor. Winds scream down into it for no known reason, and compasses fail within a mile radius. Locals believe it’s a divine wound or “mouth of the earth.” Serathian excavation teams guard the rim but report dreams, madness, and lost time.
- The [[Temple of the Burning Sigil]] - Great Solimir Sands
		A half-buried ruin with a floating glyph that pulses faintly in the sky above it. Serathians claim it marks the site where flame magic was first given to mortals. No records of the temple exist prior to 700 years ago. Religious orders fight over who owns the site.
- Marenthos Port
		A major Serathian trade city with a strange phenomenon: every few years, tides invert and crash inland with no celestial cause. Locals believe it's the sea “refreshing its memory.” City officials have banned discussion of “mirror tides,” punishing those who try to research it.
