Epai is a small island nation to the south of [[Plimiria]]. It is a small Tribal Confederation, ruled under by a high-chieftain. It is known for being quite primiative and savage lands.

Hook: The High Chieftan of Epai has ruled for over 130 years. He hasn't aged. The tribes whisper of an oath made to something beneath the volcanic mountain.
