One shattered by the Sundering Convergence, Aurius is one of the most prosperous continents on (placeholder planet) Post-Sundering. It has 3 states vying for control. The [[Hoxanad Empire]], the [[Varethian Dynasty]], and the [[Cidrid Kingdom]]. 

### Geographical Features
Aurius has many geographical features and can be divided up into 3 sections. The [[Northern Plains]], [[The Convergence Belt]], and [[Vareth's Landing]].

### Political Landscape
- The [[Hoxanad Empire]] dominates the [[Northern plains]] with military strength and aggressive expansion.
- The [[Cidrid Kingdom]] controls much of [[the Convergence belt]] and seeks to exploit its resources with its council of High-Scholars.
- The [[Varethian Dynasty]], oldest of the tree, holds [[Vareth's Landing]], the fabled cradle of civilization on Aurius, but has declined in power.

#### Current Tensions: 
- Hoxanad forces are pressing southward, challenging Cidrid's border fortresses and creating tension.
- Cidrid's council of High-Scholars have been hard at work in the Convergence Belt, and their strange deeds are causing tense relations with most of the continent.
- Rumors stir of independent factions rising through the Varethian Dynasty, becoming upset with the bad living conditions and their corrupted leader, and hope to restore it to the former glory.

### Points of Interest
- [[Tether's Cradle]] - A strange crater where gravitational anomalies seem to warp space. Forbidden to enter by all 3 powers. Something beneath the surface hums.
- [[The Varethian Vault]] - The rumored sealed tomb of the original founder of the Varethian Empire, said to hold a magical artifact of unfathamable proportions. None who have gone to search for it have returned.
- [[Ashroot Basin]] -  An anomalous region in east of the [[Northern Plains]], overrun with wild magic storms and anomalous plants.  Local Fauna have began to mutate and threaten some close Hoxanad settlements.
