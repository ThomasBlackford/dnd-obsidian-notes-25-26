The Northern Plains is a large, flat area on the northern side of Aurius. It is largely dominated by the Hoxanad empire. 

### Geography and Climate
The Northern Plains are mostly flat wind-swept plains of yellow grass. The temperature here is quite comfortable, but the winters can get quite cold. It rains an average amount, and goes through normal seasons as you would expect. The region is quite rich in strategic resources, like Iron and Metals, alongside having many strong "workable" animals used for labor deeds by the locals. Some unique features stand out here, such as the [[Sky-Splitter Mountains]], the tallest mountain range on (placeholder planet), said to be where a legendary hero defeated a dragon. This region also has a major river, the [[Silverstream River]] that flows through the eastern portion of the plains, said to be home to major silver deposits.

### Settlements
A majority of the Hoxanad Empires large settlements are situated in the eastern region of the Northern Plains. The capital, [[Kaedrun]], is situated right in the edge of [[Gulf of First Breath]]. Another notable city is [[Crota]], a large city situated by the Sky-Splitter Mountains and nearby the Silverstream river. Multiple towns also populate the plains.
