#dm-only #unfinished #sundering

The truth behind the most important, and most forgotten, event in the world's history. Known only to a handful of entities.

## What caused it?
The sundering was caused by the activation of an ancient machine known as [[The Brass God]], a massive construct of unknowable origin and purpose. Why it was fired, and by whom, remains unknown... for now. (flesh this out later.)

## What happened in the Sundering?
- Two parallel timelines forcibly collided and fused.
    
- Some small-scale geographic anomalies formed (e.g., the Obsidian Maw, slight tectonic distortions).
    
- A second sun, the [[Forge Sun]], appeared in the sky — unpredictable and never fully consistent.
    
- Most of the population alive at the time had their memories rewritten.
    
- Entire cities, dynasties, or regions may have emerged or disappeared, with no one realizing it.

## Who knows or remembers?
Only a small handful know the truth. No more than 5 or 6 across the world. i will flesh this out later.

## What are its lasting effects?
- Geographic anomalies (e.g., floating spires, sealed vaults, impossible ruins)
    
- A second sun — the Forge Sun, still misunderstood, often worshiped or feared
    
- Some nations and bloodlines may unknowingly originate from the alternate timeline
    
- The Brass God still exists, somewhere in the world — dormant, buried, sealed, or hidden.

## Why does it matter now?
- Someone or something is trying to trigger another Sundering.
- The players will unravel the truth piece by piece across the campaign.
- Key POIs, relics, or factions are unknowingly connected to the first sundering.
- Some truths, if revealed, could collapse kingdoms or rewrite history.
